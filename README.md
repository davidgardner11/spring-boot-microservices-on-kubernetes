# Deploy Java Spring Boot microservices on Kubernetes

Spring Boot is one of the popular Java microservices framework. Spring Cloud has a rich set of well integrated Java libraries to address runtime concerns as part of the Java application stack, and Kubernetes provides a rich featureset to run polyglot microservices. Together these technologies complement each other and make a great platform for Spring Boot applications.

In this code we demonstrate how a simple Spring Boot application can be deployed on top of Kubernetes. This application, Office Space, mimicks the fictitious app idea from Michael Bolton in the movie [Office Space](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151804/). The app takes advantage of a financial program that computes interest for transactions by diverting fractions of a cent that are usually rounded off into a seperate bank account.

The application includes a few services and they are written in different languages.
   * The key coponent of the application is a Java 8/Spring Boot microservice that computes the interest then takes the fraction of the pennies to a database. 
   * Another Spring Boot microservice is the notification service. It sends email when the account balance reach more than $50,000. It is triggered by the Spring Boot webserver that computes the interest. 
   * The frontend user interafce is a Node.js application that shows the current account balance accumulated by the Spring Boot app. 
   * The backend uses a MySQL database to store the account balance.
   * The transaction generator is a Python application that generates random transactions with accumulated interest. It's the last piece of your service mesh and used to simulate the transaction activities.

During this session, we focus on deploying the microservices due to time constraint. Feel free to review the source code of the services, if you are interested.

The instructions were adapted from the more comprehensive tutorial found here - https://github.com/IBM/spring-boot-microservices-on-kubernetes.


## Flow

![spring-boot-kube](images/architecture.png)

1. The Transaction Generator service written in Python simulates transactions and pushes them to the Compute Interest microservice.
2. The Compute Interest microservice computes the interest and then moves the fraction of pennies to the MySQL database to be stored. The database can be running within a container in the same deployment or on a public cloud such as IBM Cloud.
3. The Compute Interest microservice then calls the notification service to notify the user when the total amount in the user’s account reaches $50,000.
4. The Notification service uses IBM Cloud Function to send an email message to the user.
5. The front end user interface in Node.js retrieves the account balance and display.

## Included Components

* [Compose for MySQL](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/compose-for-mysql): Probably the most popular open source relational database in the world.
* [IBM Cloud Functions](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/openwhisk): Execute code on demand in a highly scalable, serverless environment.

## Featured Technologies

* [Container Orchestration](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/container-service): Automating the deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications.
* [Databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Information_Management_System#.22Full_Function.22_databases): Repository for storing and managing collections of data.
* [Serverless](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/functions): An event-action platform that allows you to execute code in response to an event.

## Prerequisite

   * Access to a Kubernetes cluster - A cluster was created when the session started

   * IBM Cloud Function sending email notification - was created before the session

   * Docker image of each service has been made available on Docker Hub.


## Setup

1. Lab Environment Setup

    Every time when you start a new terminal/command window, steps in the section must be performed to setup a new environment.

    [Follow the instructions here](README_pre02.md)


## Steps

1. Clone the repo
2. Modify send-notification.yaml file for email notification
3. Deploy Database `MySQL` service
4. Deploy Microservice `compute-interest-api`
5. Deploy Microservice `send-notification`
6. Deploy Microservice `account-summary` - the Frontend User Interface
7. Deploy Microservice `transaction-generator` - the Transaction Generator service
8. Access Your Application

Each service in the application run in their containers. It has a Deployment and a Service. The deployment manages the pods started for each microservice. The Service creates a stable DNS entry for each microservice so they can reference their dependencies by name.


### 1. Clone the repo

Clone this repository. In a terminal, run:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/lee-zhg/spring-boot-microservices-on-kubernetes

$ cd  spring-boot-microservices-on-kubernetes
```


### 2. Modify send-notification.yaml file for email notification

> **Note: Additional Gmail security configurations may be required by Gmail to send/received email in this way.**

Optionally, if you like to send and receive email (gmail) notification, You will need to modify the **environment variables** in the `send-notification.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
    env:
    - name: GMAIL_SENDER_USER
       value: 'username@gmail.com' # change this to the gmail that will send the email
    - name: GMAIL_SENDER_PASSWORD
       value: 'password' # change this to the the password of the gmail above
    - name: EMAIL_RECEIVER
       value: 'sendTo@gmail.com' # change this to the email of the receiver
   ```


### 3. Deploy `MySQL` Database

   * Deploy MySQL database

      ```bash
      $ kubectl create -f account-database.yaml
      service "account-database" created
      deployment "account-database" created
      ```

   * Create a secure storing credential of MySQL database

      Default credentials are already encoded in base64 in secrets.yaml.

      > Note: Encoding in base64 does not encrypt or hide your secrets. Do not put this in your Github.

      ```
      $ kubectl apply -f secrets.yaml
      secret "demo-credentials" created
      ```


### 4. Deploy `compute-interest-api` service

Microservice `compute-interest-api` is written in Spring Boot. It's deployed to your cluster as one component of your service mesh.

   ```bash
   $ kubectl apply -f compute-interest-api.yaml
   service "compute-interest-api" created
   deployment "compute-interest-api" created
   ```


### 5. Deploy `send-notification` service

Microservice `send-notification` is written in Spring Boot. It's deployed to your cluster as one component of your service mesh.

   ```bash
   $ kubectl apply -f send-notification.yaml
   service "send-notification" created
   deployment "send-notification" created
   ```


### 6. Deploy `account-summary` service - the Frontend User Interface

The Frontend User Interface is a Node.js app serving static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) that shows the total account balance. It's another component of your service mesh.

   ```bash
   $ kubectl apply -f account-summary.yaml
   service "account-summary" created
   deployment "account-summary" created
   ```


### 7. Deploy `transaction-generator` service - the Transaction Generator service

The transaction generator is a Python application that generates random transactions with accumulated interest. It's the last piece of your service mesh.

   ```bash
   $ kubectl apply -f transaction-generator.yaml
   service "transaction-generator" created
   deployment "transaction-generator" created
   ```

### 8. Access Your Application

One way to access your application is through `Public IP` and `NodePort`.

* Locate public IP address

   ```bash
   $ ibmcloud cs workers <cluster-name>
   ID                                                 Public IP        Private IP      Machine Type   State    Status   
   kube-dal10-paac005a5fa6c44786b5dfb3ed8728548f-w1   169.47.241.213   10.177.155.13   free           normal   Ready  
   ```

   Take note of `Public IP`. `169.47.241.213` in this example.

* Locate NodePort

   ```bash
   $ kubectl get svc
   NAME                    CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                                                                      AGE
   ......
   account-summary         10.10.10.74    <nodes>       80:30080/TCP                                                                 2d
   ......
   ```

   Take note of `PORT(S)` of the service `account-summary`. `30080` in the example.

* Access your application

   To test your application, go to `http://<Public IP>:<Port>` in your browser. For example, http://169.47.241.213:30080 in this example.

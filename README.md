# Build and deploy Java Spring Boot microservices on Kubernetes

Spring Boot is one of the popular Java microservices framework. Spring Cloud has a rich set of well integrated Java libraries to address runtime concerns as part of the Java application stack, and Kubernetes provides a rich featureset to run polyglot microservices. Together these technologies complement each other and make a great platform for Spring Boot applications.

In this code we demonstrate how a simple Spring Boot application can be deployed on top of Kubernetes. This application, Office Space, mimicks the fictitious app idea from Michael Bolton in the movie [Office Space](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151804/). The app takes advantage of a financial program that computes interest for transactions by diverting fractions of a cent that are usually rounded off into a seperate bank account.

The application uses a Java 8/Spring Boot microservice that computes the interest then takes the fraction of the pennies to a database. Another Spring Boot microservice is the notification service. It sends email when the account balance reach more than $50,000. It is triggered by the Spring Boot webserver that computes the interest. The frontend uses a Node.js app that shows the current account balance accumulated by the Spring Boot app. The backend uses a MySQL database to store the account balance.

The instructions were adapted from the more comprehensive tutorial found here - https://github.com/IBM/spring-boot-microservices-on-kubernetes.

## Flow

![spring-boot-kube](images/architecture.png)

1. The Transaction Generator service written in Python simulates transactions and pushes them to the Compute Interest microservice.
2. The Compute Interest microservice computes the interest and then moves the fraction of pennies to the MySQL database to be stored. The database can be running within a container in the same deployment or on a public cloud such as IBM Cloud.
3. The Compute Interest microservice then calls the notification service to notify the user if an amount has been deposited in the userâ€™s account.
4. The Notification service uses IBM Cloud Function to send an email message to the user.
5. The user retrieves the account balance by visiting the Node.js web interface.

# Prerequisite

   * Access to a Kubernetes cluster - A cluster was created when the session started

   * IBM Cloud Function sending email notification - was created for the session


# Steps
1. [Clone the repo](#1-clone-the-repo)
2. [Create the Database service](#2-create-the-database-service)
3. [Create the Spring Boot Microservices](#3-create-the-spring-boot-microservices)
4. [Use IBM Cloud Functions with Notification service *(Optional)*](#4-use-ibm-cloud-functions-with-notification-service)
5. [Deploy the Microservices](#5-deploy-the-microservices)
6. [Access Your Application](#6-access-your-application)


### 1. Clone the repo

Clone this repository. In a terminal, run:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/IBM/spring-boot-microservices-on-kubernetes

$ cd  spring-boot-microservices-on-kubernetes
```


### 2. Modify send-notification.yaml file for email notification

> **Note: Additional Gmail security configurations are required by Gmail to send/received email in this way.**

Optionally, if you like to send and receive email (gmail) notification, You will need to modify the **environment variables** in the `send-notification.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
    env:
    - name: GMAIL_SENDER_USER
       value: 'username@gmail.com' # change this to the gmail that will send the email
    - name: GMAIL_SENDER_PASSWORD
       value: 'password' # change this to the the password of the gmail above
    - name: EMAIL_RECEIVER
       value: 'sendTo@gmail.com' # change this to the email of the receiver
   ```


### 3. Create the Database service

MySQL database and each microservice run in their containers. 

Each microservice has a Deployment and a Service. The deployment manages
the pods started for each microservice. The Service creates a stable
DNS entry for each microservice so they can reference their
dependencies by name.

   * Deploy MySQL database

      ```bash
      $ kubectl create -f account-database.yaml
      service "account-database" created
      deployment "account-database" created
      ```

   * Create a secure storing credential of MySQL database

      Default credentials are already encoded in base64 in secrets.yaml.

      > Note: Encoding in base64 does not encrypt or hide your secrets. Do not put this in your Github.

      ```
      $ kubectl apply -f secrets.yaml
      secret "demo-credentials" created
      ```


### 4. Use IBM Cloud Functions with Notification service

> This is an optional step if you want to try IBM Cloud Functions

Create action for sending **Gmail Notification**
```bash
$ ibmcloud cf action create sendEmailNotification sendEmail.js --web true
```

* Test Actions

You can test your IBM Cloud Function Actions using `wsk action invoke [action name] [add --param to pass  parameters]`

Invoke Email Notification
```bash
$ wsk action invoke sendEmailNotification --param sender [sender email] --param password [sender password]--param receiver [receiver email] --param subject [Email subject] --param text [Email Body]
```
You should receive a slack message and receive an email respectively.

* Create REST API for Actions

You can map REST API endpoints for your created actions using `wsk api create`. The syntax for it is `wsk api create [base-path] [api-path] [verb (GET PUT POST etc)] [action name]`

Create endpoint for **Gmail Notification**
```bash
$ wsk api create /v1 /email POST sendEmailNotification
ok: created API /v1/email POST for action /_/sendEmailNotification
https://service.us.apiconnect.ibmcloud.com/gws/apigateway/api/.../v1/email
```

You can view a list of your APIs with this command:

```bash
$ wsk api list

ok: APIs
Action                                      Verb  API Name  URL
/Anthony.Amanse_dev/sendEmailNotificatio    post       /v1  https://service.us.apiconnect.ibmcloud.com/gws/apigateway/api/.../v1/email
/Anthony.Amanse_dev/testDefault             post       /v1  https://service.us.apiconnect.ibmcloud.com/gws/apigateway/api/.../v1/slack
```

Take note of your API URLs. You are going to use them later.


![Slack Notification](images/slackNotif.png)

Test endpoint for **Gmail Notification**. Replace the URL with your own API URL. Replace the value of the parameters **sender, password, receiver, subject** with your own.

```bash
$ curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' -d '{ "text": "Hello from OpenWhisk", "subject": "Email Notification", "sender": "testemail@gmail.com", "password": "passwordOfSender", "receiver": "receiversEmail" }' https://service.us.apiconnect.ibmcloud.com/gws/apigateway/api/.../v1/email
```
![Email Notification](images/emailNotif.png)

* Add REST API Url to yaml files

Once you have confirmed that your APIs are working, put the URLs in your `send-notification.yaml` file
```yaml
env:
- name: GMAIL_SENDER_USER
  value: 'username@gmail.com' # the sender's email
- name: GMAIL_SENDER_PASSWORD
  value: 'password' # the sender's password
- name: EMAIL_RECEIVER
  value: 'sendTo@gmail.com' # the receiver's email
- name: OPENWHISK_API_URL_EMAIL
  value: 'https://service.us.apiconnect.ibmcloud.com/gws/apigateway/api/.../v1/email' # your API endpoint for email notifications
```

### 5. Deploy the Microservices

* Deploy Spring Boot Microservices

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f compute-interest-api.yaml
service "compute-interest-api" created
deployment "compute-interest-api" created
```

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f send-notification.yaml
service "send-notification" created
deployment "send-notification" created
```

* Deploy the Frontend service

The UI is a Node.js app serving static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) that shows the total account balance.

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f account-summary.yaml
service "account-summary" created
deployment "account-summary" created
```

* Deploy the Transaction Generator service
The transaction generator is a Python app that generates random transactions with accumulated interest.

Create the transaction generator **Python** app:
```bash
$ kubectl apply -f transaction-generator.yaml
service "transaction-generator" created
deployment "transaction-generator" created
```

### 6. Access Your Application
You can access your app publicly through your Cluster IP and the NodePort. The NodePort should be **30080**.

* To find your IP:
```bash
$ ibmcloud cs workers <cluster-name>
ID                                                 Public IP        Private IP      Machine Type   State    Status   
kube-dal10-paac005a5fa6c44786b5dfb3ed8728548f-w1   169.47.241.213   10.177.155.13   free           normal   Ready  
```

* To find the NodePort of the account-summary service:
```bash
$ kubectl get svc
NAME                    CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                                                                      AGE
...
account-summary         10.10.10.74    <nodes>       80:30080/TCP                                                                 2d
...
```
* On your browser, go to `http://<your-cluster-IP>:30080`
